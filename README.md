### This project contains the source code generated by the Vaadin's [Full Stack Starter](https://vaadin.com/full-stack-starter) (Bakery App)

## Running the project

`mvn spring-boot:run`

Wait for the application to start

Open http://localhost:8080/ to view the application.

Default credentials are admin@vaadin.com/admin for admin access and
barista@vaadin.com/barista for normal user access.

## Running the project as an executable jar

The project is configured to automatically make the build artifact runnable using `java -jar`.
By default you can thus also run the project by executing the war file:
```
java -jar target/###artifactId###-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
```

If you want to produce a `jar` file instead of a `war` file, change the packaging type in `pom.xml` to `<packaging>jar</packaging>`.

## Running integration tests

Integration tests are implemented using TestBench. The tests take tens of minutes to run and are therefore included in a separate profile. To run the tests, execute

`mvn verify -Pit`

and make sure you have a valid TestBench license installed.

## Running scalability tests

Scalability tests can be run as follows

1. Configure the server for load testing by setting `loadtestmode.enabled=true` in `src/main/resources/application.properties`

2. Configure the number of concurrent users and a suitable ramp up time in the end of the `src/test/scala/*.scala` files, e.g.:
	```setUp(scn.inject( rampUsers(50) over (60 seconds)) ).protocols(httpProtocol)```

3. If you are not running on localhost, configure the baseUrl in the beginning of the `src/test/scala/*.scala` files, e.g.:
	```val baseUrl = "http://my.server.com"```

4. Make sure the server is running at the given URL

5. Start a test from the command line, e.g.:
	 ```mvn -Pscalability gatling:execute -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.vaadin.starter.bakery.Barista```

6. Test results are stored into target folder, e.g.:
	```target/gatling/Barista-1487784042461/index.html```

## Developing the project
